# pseudogp-paper

This repo accompanies the paper "Order under uncertainty: on the robustness of differential expression analysis using probabilistic models for pseudotime inference". It requires both the [pseudogp](http://www.github.com/kieranrcampbell/pseudogp) and [switchde](http://www.github.com/kieranrcampbell/switchde) R packages as part of the paper, as well as [scater](http://www.github.com/davismcc/scater).

It is  organised into
* `analysis`: Rmarkdown notebooks for all analysis
* `data`: All MCMC traces, embeddings and gene expression `SCESets`
